<p>Name:Wenbo He</p>
<p>Major: Computer Science</p>
<p>Hometown:Yixing</p>
<p>Interests:Vedio games, Skiing, Badminton</p>
<p>I come from Yixing, a small town in the southeast part of China.It is a small city, but I love it. This is my first year in vorment, and I love this place too. Even though I am sophomore, this is my first year studying Computer science.The reason why I choose Computer Science as my major is because I was interested in Computer when I was young. I remember when I was 6 years old, my father bought the first computer. From that computer, I learnd a lot of things from the Interenet, and started to be curious about the field of computer science.</p>
